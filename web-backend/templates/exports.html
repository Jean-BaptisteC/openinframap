    <p>We can provide exports of worldwide power and telecoms infrastructure from OpenStreetMap.</p>
    <p>Our standard export provides the following information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Power plants as polygons</li>
      <li>Substations as points and polygons</li>
      <li>Power lines</li>
      <li>Telecommunication lines</li>
      <li>Telecommunication buildings/datacenters</li>
      <li>Oil/gas sites</li>
      <li>Pipelines (all substances)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We can only provide exports of data which is visible on OpenInfraMap. If you require
      exports of other OpenStreetMap data, you may wish to consider the
      <a href="https://www.geofabrik.de/data/shapefiles.html">Geofabrik export service</a>.</p>

    <h3>Formats</h3>

    <p>Exports can be provided in many standard geospatial vector formats, such as GeoPackage, Shapefile, etc.</p>

    <p>Exports of power network data in KML (Google Earth) format, with styling and interactivity, are available
    at an additional cost. Please note that these tend to be unusuable in Google Earth for areas larger than
    a single country.</p>
